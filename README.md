AI Assistance Disclosure

This project was developed with assistance from generative AI tools:

Tool: Cursor (Powered by Claude 4.5 Sonnet)

Dates: January 24, 2026 – February 16, 2026

Scope: Code generation, autocompletion, and refactoring for both the front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) and back-end (PHP API), along with gaining insight to current system.

Use: Wrote a large portion of the foundational code. Used for rapid prototyping, generating large amounts of CSS styling, quickly refactoring files to support new features, and general code understanding.



Tool: Gemini 3 Pro (Google)

Dates: January 13, 2026 – February 16, 2026

Scope: Version control management, integration debugging, test data generation, core concept learning, code understanding and documentation drafting.

Use: Provided specific terminal commands to undo Git commits and resolve merge conflicts. Wrote custom JavaScript logic for front-end data validation (e.g., phone number parsing). Generated JSON mock data arrays for testing API endpoints in Postman. Used largely to understand core LAMP concepts, and code fundamentals. Assisted greatly in learning information. 



Tool: ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5.2)

Dates: January 15, 2026 – February 16, 2026

Scope: Course material comprehension, implementation brainstorming, and individual component testing.

Use: Utilized to understand LAMP stack concepts. Helped brainstorm coding strategies, diagnose logic errors in isolated environments, and assist with writing and testing individual code contributions before integrating them into the main project.
